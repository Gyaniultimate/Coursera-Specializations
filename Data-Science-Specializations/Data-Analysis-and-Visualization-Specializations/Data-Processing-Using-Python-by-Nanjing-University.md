# [Data Processing Using Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-processing) `20H`

## SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN
`data analysis` `python programming` `numpy` `pandas`

## About this Course
- This course (Please click https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-processing for English version) is mainly for non-computer students, starting from the basic grammar of Python to how to conduct data locally and online in Python Obtain, how to parse and represent data, then how to use Python open source ecosystem SciPy to perform basic and advanced statistical analysis and visualization of data, including specific methods of data exploration and preprocessing, and finally how to design a simple GUI interface to represent And processing data, step by step.
- The entire course is based on financial data, and by constructing a case that you like to hear, so that everyone can appreciate the simplicity, elegance and robustness of Python in a more intuitive way, while discussing Python in literature, sociology and news in addition to the business field. Humanities and social sciences, as well as science and engineering fields such as mathematics and biology, also have convenient and efficient data processing capabilities, and can be flexibly applied to various majors by analogy.
- Recently (updated on November 6, 2019) this course has undergone a comprehensive revision, the new version mainly made changes in the following aspects:
  - Enriched the actual operation and explanation of the Python-based case;
  - Added and expanded vector operations and broadcasting ideas and common applications such as the NumPy package, multiple links of data exploration and preprocessing, pandas-based data analysis and data mining cases, etc.
- Some are directly modified on the original video, and some are presented in the form of expanded video. Especially the newly recorded video is longer because there are a lot of things to say, and many of them are more than 20 minutes.
